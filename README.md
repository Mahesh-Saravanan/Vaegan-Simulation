# Vaegan-Simulation
This Python-based simulator offers a dynamic and comprehensive simulation of a Mobility as a Service (MaaS) company exclusively developed by and for Vaegan, a startup based in Tamilnadu, India. Designed to mirror real-world scenarios, the simulator takes into account real-time traffic conditions and distances between various service stations. By incorporating these factors, it provides a realistic portrayal of the operational challenges faced by a MaaS company.

The simulator goes beyond just tracking the movement of vehicles; it also monitors the operational expenses incurred during the service. This includes considerations for fuel costs, maintenance, and other relevant factors. Through careful analysis, the simulator calculates the profit generated by the MaaS operations.

With a focus on accuracy and practicality, this simulator serves as a valuable tool for assessing the viability and efficiency of a Mobility as a Service business model. Whether for strategic planning or educational purposes, this Python-based simulation offers insights into the intricate dynamics of running a MaaS company in a dynamic urban environment.
