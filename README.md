# Vaegan MaaS Simulator

## Overview

The Vaegan MaaS Simulator is a Python-based tool developed to replicate the operational and financial dynamics of a Mobility as a Service (MaaS) company. This simulator is exclusively designed for Vaegan, a startup based in Tamilnadu, India. The primary goal is to mirror real-world scenarios, taking into account real-time traffic conditions and distances between various service stations in the city of Coimbatore, India. By incorporating these factors, the simulator provides a realistic portrayal of the operational challenges faced by a MaaS company.

Beyond simply tracking vehicle movement, the simulator monitors operational expenses incurred during the service, including fuel costs, maintenance, and other relevant factors. Through careful analysis, the simulator calculates the profit generated by the MaaS operations.

## Usage

This simulator is entirely built using Python, and it utilizes a CSV file to store real-time information about the city. The following files are included in the repository:

1. `DT_library.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook for creating a distance matrix and travel time between stations in a given city using the Google API.
2. `Distance_matrix.npy`: A 20x20 NumPy array depicting distances between all 20 stations, calculated in `DT_library.ipynb`.
3. `Travel-Time-chart.npy`: A NumPy array illustrating travel time between stations, calculated in `DT_library.ipynb`.
4. `inward.csv`: A CSV file detailing inward traffic at each station per hour (during operational hours).
5. `outward.csv`: A CSV file outlining outward traffic at each station per hour (during operational hours).
6. `Simulation.ipynb`: The main file for simulating and plotting results.
7. `Station_coordinate.csv`: A CSV file containing latitude and longitude for each station of interest.
